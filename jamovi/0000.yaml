  The module implements Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) based upon the `smacof`
  R-package. It permits to calculate and visualize MDS solutions for symmetric
  matrices (e.g., distances, correlations or similarities), rectangular matrices
  (with individuals in rows and variables in columns), or for individual
  differences (with symmetric or sparse matrices, one for each participant,
  concatenated over rows).
