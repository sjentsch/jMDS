msgid "<h2>Additional Information</h2> <p><strong>Shape of data matrices</strong>: Data matrices have the shape that is usual for most / all other analyses included in jamovi, namely individuals (or other units of observation) as rows and variables as columns.</p> <p><strong>Type of MDS and ties</strong>: The MDS can either be metric or non-metric (ordinal). For “ordinal”, there are different choices how to deal with tied ranks: “primary” - breaks ties, i.e., distances with the same value may be assigned different ranks (with lower ranks assigned to the values that appear first in the data); “secondary” - keep ties tied, i.e., distances with the same value are assigned the same rank; or “tertiary” - requires that the means of the tie blocks are in the correct order.</p> <p><strong>Transforming similarities to distances</strong>: Typically, raw data are not already distances (i.e., ranks within each row, if columns are to be compared). If they are distamces, choose “Already Distances (no transform.)”, otherwise choose one of the following tranformations: If the data are preferences or ratings, they may be transformed by beeing reversed or ranked. When using one of these (or no) tranformation, the shape (rows and columns) of the original data is preserved and <code>smacofRect</code> is used for calculating the MDS solution. Alternatively, the transformations can be either correlating the data or calculating distances from the raw data. If correlations are calculated (over rows or columns, as indicated; and using either parametric - Pearson - or non-parametric - Kendall or Spearman - correlations), these correlations are then converted into distances. If distance measures are calculated (over rows or columns, as indicated), these can be Euclidian, Manhattan, Minkowski or Jaccard distances, and one can further determine whether these distance measures shall be calculated on the original or z-standardized data. Using correlations or distance measures as transformations changes the shape of the data matrix into a symmetric matrix (either of the size rows x rows or columns x columns), which is then analyzed using <code>smacofSym</code>.</p> <p><strong>Example datasets</strong>: jMDS comes with several example datasets that can be used to understand the different possible shapes of data matrices, and to try out the different modes of calculating a MDS.
