Description:
    The module implements Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) based upon the
    `smacof` R-package. It permits to calculate and visualize MDS solutions
    for symmetric matrices (e.g., distances, correlations or similarities),
    raw data (with individuals in rows and variables in columns), or for
    individual differences (with symmetric or sparse matrices, one for each
    participant, concatenated over rows).
